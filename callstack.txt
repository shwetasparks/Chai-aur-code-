1.{}-memory creation phase
2.execution phase

//steps of executing code
step 1- global execution context allocated in 'this'


step2 =memory phase
val1=undefines
val2=undefined
addNum= function definition
result1=undefined
result2-undefined

step 3
execution phase
val1=10
val2=5

addNum() --- again create executional context
box= new variable env + execution thread
=>delete if done--

addNum() memory phase and execution phase
memory phase->
val1=undefined
val2=undefined
total=undefined



//call stack
